# Anova-Mann-Whitney-U-Test-and-Kruskal-Wallis

I used Title with a combination of 2 words in 6 pairs and researched for the keywords in the pubmed data using pymed for years 2019,2020,2021,2022. 
Checked if the sample look gausian using shapiro test

Compared the following two categories: “Obesity”, “Cancer” on a year basis (2019, 2020, 2021). 
a. With three statistics tests, one parametric(ANOVA), two non-parametric tests(Kruskal Wallis and Mann Whitney) and report results. 
b. Used the effect size test(Cliff D), to quantify the magnitude of differences.

Used three correlation coefficient tests (Pearson, Spearman, KendallTau) and report whether the following two keywords have correlations: “Obesity”, “Cancer”.
